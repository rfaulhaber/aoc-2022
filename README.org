#+title: Advent of Code 2022

Same stuff, new year.

Each directory corresponds to a day. My own personal rules:

- Each program must ingest the input as a file
- Each day must have a Nix flake associated with it
- Each day is a randomly chosen language based on the content of [[file:LANGUAGES.txt][LANGUAGES.txt]]
- No two days can use the same language
- If Racket is chosen, and the input can be read as something language-like, it
  must be implemented as a reader language
