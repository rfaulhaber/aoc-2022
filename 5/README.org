#+title: day5

This was an attempt to make a reader language from the day5 Advent of Code
challenge. I did not succeed and I'm giving up.

At the end of the day, if you try to evaluate this, you'll run into this error:

#+begin_src
module: cannot use identifier tainted by macro transformation
#+end_src

I have no idea what this means, and I can't find any information about it.

Other issues I ran into:

1. Evaluating a custom language programmatically is not straightforward at all,
   and little guidance exists out there.
2. Implementing a non-trivial reader language is not straightforward. I could
   not figure out why Racket couldn't piece my modules together and evaluate the
   identifiers provided in the expander.
